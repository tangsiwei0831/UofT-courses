Test instructions

The files in this directory are labelled according to which question they
belong to.

You will do all of your work in 3 files: q1.txt, q2.c, and q3.c.  These files
are given to you in the starter code.

You should submit all three files to the directory test1, not to the 
subdirectories that they came in.  You will receive a warning message from 
MarkUs if these files not in the right place.

Remember that these questions will be marked by hand, so a partial solution
will still get part marks.
