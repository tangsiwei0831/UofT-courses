Q3: [5 marks] Memory Model
Consider the following code:  

struct loc {
        int x;
        int y;
        char *name;
};

struct loc *fun(struct loc a) {
        struct loc *b = malloc(sizeof(struct loc));
        b->x = a.x + 3;
        b->y  = a.y + 32;
        b->name = "here";
        return b;
}

int main() {
        struct loc home;
        home.x = 3;
        home.y = 5;
        home.name = "there";

        struct loc *away;
        away = fun(home);
}


a) The memory models given in q3-memory.pdf potentially model the memory
   allocated in the above code. State which one of the following is 
   a valid representation of the memory use of the program:
	A) Model A 
	B) Model B 
	C) Model C
	D) Model D
	E) None of models A-D are consistent with the program

ANSWER: C


b) Write TRUE if the statement below is correct, and FALSE if it is incorrect:Th
	The above code will not compile or yields a segmentation fault

ANSWER: FALSE


c) Explain what a memory leak is.

ANSWER: Lose the address of a dynamically allocated block


d) The above code does not contain a memory leak.  Why?

ANSWER: Although the stack for function fun is lost, but we can still access to the address of
away(return value of fun) in main.


e) Assuming that we are using an operating system with 64 bit memory addresses,
   provide the size of the following type in bytes

   struct house {
        char owner[80]; 
      	struct loc *location;
   };

ANSWER: 
80 + 16 = 96 bytes
